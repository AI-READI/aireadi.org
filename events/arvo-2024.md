## Overview

The theme of the 2024 Annual Meeting addresses how vision research is continually being transformed by new information and technologies. Exponentially expanding computing power is giving rise to improved artificial intelligence and powerful big data. Increasingly sensitive and elegant molecular techniques, including CRISPR and mRNA technologies, as well as more sophisticated imaging modalities, virtual reality, and breakthroughs in gene therapy are catalyzing our research as we aim to treat, cure and ultimately prevent blinding eye diseases.
