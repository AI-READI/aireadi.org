## About the series

The recently re-issued program solicitation NSF 24-523 “Expanding Capacity in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (ExpandQISE)” aims to increase research capacity and broaden participation in Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE). With grants up to $5 million over up to five years, depending on track, the program will expand quantum engagement to new institutions, with a particular focus on those where more than half of students are from groups historically under-represented in the sciences.

The ExpandQISE Management Team will offer office hours, designed to answer questions from all potential applicants. Potential PIs from eligible Institutions, as well as Co-PIs from all Institutions with established efforts in any of the sub-fields of QISE are encouraged to participate. During office hours NSF Program Officers will be available via zoom to answer questions about the solicitation, proposal submission, merit review process etc.
