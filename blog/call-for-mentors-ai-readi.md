We are excited to share two paid mentorship opportunities with the AIM-AHEAD Collaborative Supplemental Training Program!
AIM-AHEAD (Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning Consortium to Advance Health Equity and Researcher Diversity) is an NIH-supported program that aims to foster collaboration and enhance representation in AI/ML development. By becoming a mentor, you can support trainees from the AIM-AHEAD Training Program. 
One mentorship opportunity is specifically for members of the AI-READI Consortium while the other one is open to all.
