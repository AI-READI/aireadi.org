Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to participate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## November 2023

This month, Dr. Salimi offered insights for data management, machine learning, and responsible data science, emphasizing the significance of handling selection bias in algorithmic decision-making. You can find a recording to his talk [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/JGgT9SDA27Aaoir2qbwf2mGm)
