Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to particpate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## September 2023

This month, Dr Mathews provided an overview of the recent NASEM consensus study report that focused on the use of race and ethnicity and other population descriptors in genomics research, including the recommendations made by the committee. She offered some reflections on the report from an ethics perspective and discussed potential lessons for AI-READI. You can find a recording to her talk [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/KNgYxCzBShfhdY7obPpDiz4Q)
