Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to particpate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## May 2024:

This month, Cybil Roehrenbeck discussed the rapidly evolving landscape of AI regulations in clinical settings. Policymakers swiftly adopted new rules, and the talk provided a comprehensive overview of the applicable laws and regulations for developers and users of AI medical technologies. Key topics included privacy, liability, commercialization, research, and authorization issues. [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/oGPDHP411SEdM2ENGNt9bfRq)
