Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to participate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## October 2023:

This month, Dr. Malin drew upon examples from large-scale data-driven projects like the EMR and bio-repository at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, the eMERGE consortium of the NIH, and the All of Us Research Program, aiming to create a comprehensive database of EMRs, genome sequences, and mHealth records from one million Americans.You can find a recording to his talk [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/YjPGqeLizC6PawLn3fstTa4P)
