Every month, ETAI will be sharing a term or concept of the month that is related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The `Term of the Month` is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## Term of August 2023: Social License

In a recent article in the Stanford Social Innovation Review, a group of authors “define a social license as the process of building trust and legitimacy from ongoing (i.e., constantly renewed) community or stakeholder engagement and acceptance of how data is being accessed and reused.”  
We invite the AI-READI team to read the [article](https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://ssir.org/articles/entry/the_urgent_need_to_reimagine_data_consent__;!!LLK065n_VXAQ!lDb8W7AXHvROJnDCTXO5SrOo1qQuCmsANB2HElJhsgIGxNSxQ0gTwa8mxXxRq1vojehLpV71JgFqpA0HtbDiNL7AdfuH$) and consider how the concept of social license may or may not be relevant to our study.
