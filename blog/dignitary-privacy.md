Every month, ETAI will be sharing a term or concept of the month that is related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The `Term of the Month` is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## Term of September 2023: Dignitary Privacy

“Dignitary privacy is based on a belief that privacy is intrinsically valuable, whereas resource privacy is based on a belief that privacy is simply a tool that has instrumental value.”

Hughes, RL David. "Two concepts of privacy." Computer Law & Security Review 31.4 (2015): 527-537.
