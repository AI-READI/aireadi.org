Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to particpate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## March 2024:

This month, Dr. Gupta discussed causal fairness principles to mitigate bias and promote equity in healthcare using MIMIC 3 data. By addressing the causal factors behind health disparities, healthcare systems can implement interventions targeting the root causes of inequity, fostering a more just and equitable healthcare landscape. You can find a recording to his talk [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/NXEwDiebuyAm6XvRhviqqoHh)
