Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to particpate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## July 2023

This month, Dr. Goldenberg discussed the evolving ethical, legal, and social concerns (ELSI) associated with biorepositories and biobanking. The discussion covers a range of topics, including legal cases and ongoing research in this domain, particularly focusing on privacy issues, heightened equity considerations, shifts in Return on Research (ROR), and matters related to trust and trustworthiness.
