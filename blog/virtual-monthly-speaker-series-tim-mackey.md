Every month, ETAI will invite a speaker to particpate in a monthly speaker series related to ethical issues in biomedical research. The monthly speaker series is part of our module's milestones relating to engagement and reflection on ethics with the AI-READI team.

## February 2024

This month, Dr. Mackey discussed a project funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in partnership with The Native Biodata Consortium to develop a blockchain-based governance system for managing Indigenous genomic data. He described the prototype's architecture, including features like privacy preservation, distributed governance, and token/voting rights.
