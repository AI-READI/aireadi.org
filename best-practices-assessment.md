## 7. Suggested automation tools/Developer experience

- [x] 7.1. Unless you have a preferred code editor, use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for developing your code and include the `.vscode` directory in your GitHub repository.
- [x] 7.2. Use these VS Code extensions (or their equivalent in your preferred code editor) as applicable to your project to automatically implement some elements of the best practices:
  - [x] 7.2.1. [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments): Help you create more human-friendly comments and visualize them in your code.
  - [x] 7.2.2. [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint): Integrates ESLint code formatting into VS Code for Javascript projects.
  - [x] 7.2.3. [Isort](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.isort): A Visual Studio Code extension that provides import sorting for Python using isort.
  - [x] 7.2.4. [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) - Code formatter: Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.
  - [x] 7.2.5. [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin): A TypeScript server plugin to make the TypeScript server know `*.vue` files.
- [ ] 7.3. Use an appropriate linter for additional code quality checks before pushing a commit (eg: [Flake](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/)/[Black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) for Python, [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)/[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for Javascript, etc.)
- [ ] 7.4. When adding automated testing to your application try to use the following testing frameworks if possible:
  - [ ] 7.4.1. Javascript:
    - [ ] 7.4.1.1. Unit/Integration - [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/)/[Jest](https://jestjs.io/)
    - [ ] 7.4.1.2. End-to-end - [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)
  - [ ] 7.4.2. Python:
    - [ ] 7.4.1.3. Unit/Integration - [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.2.x/)
- [x] 7.5. Use [GitHub actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to automate tasks such as fixing grammatical errors, formatting code, managing GitHub issue submission, stale issues, and PRs, running unit/integration or end-to-end tests, building and releasing app/api/documentation versions on GitHub and Zenodo.
- [x] 7.6. Use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) for any web/Node.js applications instead of JavaScript where possible.
- [ ] 7.7. Use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) for developing and maintaining simple hostable development and/or user documentation
- [x] 7.8. Use [FAIRshare](https://docs.fairshareapp.io/docs/intro) to create metadata files easily, make GitHub releases, share software files on Zenodo, and register the software on bio.tools
- [ ] 7.9. Mirror repository on GitLab for backup. The AI-READI organization has GitLab sync automatically set up so no further actions are required
